                <p>He began by trading chocolate and various sweets fromvarious manufacturers.
                    The great demand for chocolateand sweets prompted him to create his own chocolate andcreate
                    his ownchocolate factory. Jan Tobler, together with his sons, established a chocolate
                    factory in 1899 under the name Fabrique de Chocolat Berne, Tobler & Cie. In 1900,
                    Jan Tobler transferredcontrol of the chocolate factoryto his son, Theodor Tobler.

                <p>In 1908,
                    Theodor Tobler with his cousin Emil Baumann invented a unique recipe for new chocolate and
                    gave it a unique shape in the form of triangular slices and the taste of milk chocolate, honey and
                    almond nougat. This chocolate is called Toblerone, which came from a combinationof the Tobler
                    surname and the Italian word Torrone, meaning a special kind of almond nougat.

                <p>Wake up your soul and immerse yourself in the unique taste of the unique Toblerone
                    chocolate. Our cocoa trees grow in hot and humid areas north and south of
                    the equator. Every day, such trees give from 21 to 51 fruits, which
                    contain up to 50 quality cocoa beans. The appearance of the trees and the composition
                    of the soil affects the difference in the aroma, taste and color of the chocolate, which is why
                    our cocoa beans are collected in the best places around the world.

                <p> For a better taste,
                    Toblerone chocolate is added to milk, which is produced in Switzerland.
                    The filling consists of almonds, honey, sugar and our secret nougat recipe,
                    which gives Toblerone chocolate such a unique and inimitable taste. Honey gives
                    the chocolate anintense aroma that gives Toblerone honey-almond nougat
                    this refined and unforgettable taste.

                <p>For many years it was believed that the triangular shape went to chocolate from the famous Swiss mountain - Matterhorn. But now, company historians have disproved
                    this legend. When the product appeared on the market in 1908, the Matterhorn image was not yet on the packaging or in the advertisement.
                    The famous mountain began to decorate the wrapper only in 1970. But another legend about the triangular shape of chocolate did not
                    find the support of historians. There was a version according to which Theodore Tobler was inspired by the Parisian variety show dancers Folies Bergeres.

                    Tobler, who was looking for a chocolate bar alternative to a tile, found inspiration either in the pyramid that the girls were building at the end of the
                    performance, or saw this shape in the order of the legs of the participants in a spicy revue. However, such a hypothesis did not find documentary evidence. No one in the
                    company eventually knows how Toblerone became triangular. It was probably a wonderful insight. Many people do not notice that in the image
                    of Mount Matterhorn symbolizing the city of Bern, a bear is hiding, and if you look in the lower right corner, you can also see the outlines of the fish.
